## 🛠️How and Why did we make it?

Uniwork was made in the course of 3 days as a project for our class @Becode where we had to create a a fictive startup and get experience working in a team, paying attention to all the nitty gritty of making a working layout and keep in cmind that we're both working on the same project and not just doing our own thing.
